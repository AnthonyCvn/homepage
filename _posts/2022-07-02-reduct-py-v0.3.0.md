Good news everyone!

Reduct Storage Python SDK [v0.3.0](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-py/releases/tag/v0.3.0) has been released.

It supports the latest Reduct Storage HTTP API v0.6.0, but the most important change is data streaming. Let's see how it works with examples!

## Prerequisites

This post isn't a tutorial, and I suppose you know how to launch an instance of Reduct Storage and create a bucket there. If you don't know, then a few links that can help:

* [Getting Started](https://docs.reduct-storage.dev/)
* [Usage example of the Python SDK](https://reduct-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#example)

## Read Data By Chunks

In this release, we introduced a new method `Bucket.read_by` to read data by chunks with an asynchronous iterator:

```python
 with open("file.bin", "wb") as file:
     async for chunk in bucket.read_by("entry-1", chunk_size=1024):
         file.write(chunk)
```

<!--more-->

It might be useful when you have a big record to download or need to read many records in the same time.

## Write Data By Chunks

To write data by chunks, can be a bit more tricky. First, you have to pass an asynchronous iterator to the `Bucket.write` method. Then you have to specify the size of the data which you're writing. The storage engine requires the `content-lenght` header, and the user should know the size of written data in advance.

```python
file_path = Path("./path/to/file")
async def sender():
    with open(file_path, "br") as file:
         while True:
             chunk = file.read(1024)
             if not chunk:
                 break
             yield chunk

content_length = file_path.stat().st_size
await bucket.write("entry-1", sender(), content_length=content_length)
```
